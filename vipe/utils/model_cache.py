"""Cache for heavy, stateless models, owned by the pipeline.

The annotation pipeline is run once per video stream, and several large
networks (the metric depth model, GeoCalib, and the SAM / GroundingDINO / AOT
networks behind TrackAnything) were previously rebuilt from scratch for every
stream. Loading those weights from disk and transferring them to the GPU is the
dominant cost of the gap between "Processing <name>" and the first progress
bar tick.

These networks are used strictly for inference (``eval()`` + ``no_grad``), so a
single instance can be shared across all streams. A ``Pipeline`` holds one
``ModelCache`` and threads it into the processors and the SLAM system it builds;
the cache builds each model once, on first request, and hands back the same
instance afterwards. Only the *weight-holding* networks are cached here;
per-video state (SAM image embeddings, the AOT memory bank, tracking
bookkeeping) is rebuilt per stream by the callers so nothing leaks between
videos.
